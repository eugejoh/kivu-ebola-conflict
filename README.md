# kivu-ebola-conflict

what we want to do (from eugejoh):

* Create a dashboard or something interactive visualization that shows changes over time (with Ebola and conflict data)
* Overlay conflicts and Ebola cases (point in polygon operations to the admin 2 level), maybe get a rate for cases per conflicts in a geographic region (as a metric to compare the basic relation to the two datasets)
* A potential statistical analysis would be doing a spatial autocorrelation or clustering analysis (Global/Local Moran's I or G statistic)  - this I haven't done in any detail but something I've wanted to try doing in R

* can we get an "excess cases due to conflict" number? 

data sources: 
* [conflict](https://www.acleddata.com/data)
* [ebola](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ebola-cases-and-deaths-drc-north-kivu)
* [health zone borders](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/dr-congo-health-0)

maybe useful?
* [DHS population data](https://www.dhsprogram.com/what-we-do/survey/survey-display-421.cfm)
